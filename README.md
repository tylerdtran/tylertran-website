Hi, I'm Tyler Tran and this is my portfolio website. I built this website using typescript, react.js, sass and vercel for hosting. 
This website realistically began a little less than 3 years ago. I was fresh off of building my first ever website using html, css,
and a little bit of javascript (realistically i had no idea what i was doing w/ JS and still don't really). I won't lie vanilla 
javascript is not for me lol. But basically, I was in the process of building a portfolio website. I copied some code off of github 
from an at the time, "small youtuber" called codegrid who created amazing, dramatic website templates and surely I thought it would be 
super easy to build my own websites. However, I soon became overwhelmed with the endless possibility of what I could do and by how long 
the entire process would take using the classic html, css, and javascript tech stack. I didn't dare delve into react or any javascript framework
fearing that the learning curve would be too difficult, but realistically I think I just wasn't mature or ambitious enough to learning 
a front-end framework, which in hindsight, had I decided to put the effort to learn react, would reduce the project time of the portfolio website
significantly. But thinking back, I just wasn't ready and I guess 3 years later as a college student fresh off of his second year, now I was. 
I made this website literally in 5 days. Thinking back I projected it to take 2 weeks and it just really proves to me that how much more 
productive I am when I enjoy the process of creation and building step-by-step. I really do hope to come back to this website and look to add 
additional features and cleanup some of the little details to further refine my project. But for now I hope you enjoy it! 
To run the website locally, clone the project:
Move into the directory of the project 
Then run 
```
npm install 
```
Then run 
```
npm start
```
