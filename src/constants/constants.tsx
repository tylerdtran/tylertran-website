        date: '12-22-2023',
        blog: 'I have been very much interested in the ideals of cantonese cooking lately. Namely the level of worksmanship and craft required to make it just right. Food tells me a story, a story that I am hoping to pass down to others in the near future. My mother is the best cook I have ever known. What she makes represents the true essence of what true cantonese/vietnamese cooking should be like. She finds a way to maximize the flavors in a dish while simultaneously maintaining balance and harmony through her own intuition. I would say the true premise of cantonese cooking is often rooted in the infusion of various sweet, savory/salty, and sour flavors characteristic of the food down in southern china. For me in my limited experience cooking, this very intuition is quite challenging to master, there must occur a extensive round of trial and error to master such flavors but whatâ€™s equally as important in cooking is having the taste for whatâ€™s delicious is largely acquired over years and years of eating that very food. After all traditional recipes are what they are because they work. Deviations such as the new wave of TikTok trends in cooking tend to deviate from what works in hopes of gaining attraction and being avant garde. But rather Iâ€™ve always found that something was off about the food I made when I followed such recipes. And thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m looking to tell stories and reinvest my interest in my culture and language through food.'
